# Features
This aims to be a production ready template repo that uses Go, Huma, Gin, Gorm, Postgres, Docker, and OTel.

* Example reads + write api endpoints with both ORM and raw SQL to Postgres.
* Test coverage for the routes including one fuzzy test example.
* Automatic DB migrations when running locally so the GORM models can be updated and the changes reflected in postgres.
* Runs 100% in Docker using Docker Compose and a simple make file with common commands.
* Logging. Using the ZeroLog framework all logs will go to both to Stdout and a log file.
* OTel telemetry + metrics + logging. OTel collector plus 3 backends (Jaeger, Zipkin, Prometheus)
* Sets and reads from Env vars in both docker and locally.
* OpenAPI spec generated and enforced at run time (Huma). Think FastAPI.
* Linting. Has most of the GolangCi-lint linters enables.
* Tests + linting enforced by Github actions on pullrequest and merge queue
* Builds and pushes a production image using Google distroless base image to Githubs container artafact storage.
* 37MB production docker image.
